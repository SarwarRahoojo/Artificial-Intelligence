**Guido Van Rossum developed python** (high-level programming language) as a hobby project in 1991. Machine learning experts prefer python programming because of its open-source libraries. Many researchers and developers from all around the world are contributing in developing new tools and libraries to create easiness in python programming. Python IDEs are available free where programmer can write, compile, debug and run python code. PyCharm, Spyder, Thonny, IDLE are few of the python IDEs. Jupyter notebook is another platform where you can write, compile and run the code and visualize the results of tab separately.
**Kaggle** is the world's largest data science community with powerful tools and resources to help you achieve your data science goals. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine-learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. To be the part of Kaggle community and utilize their resources you will have to create an account. We will use online Jupyter notebook environment of Kaggle to perform lab tasks. Follow the steps given below to open Kaggle notebook.
